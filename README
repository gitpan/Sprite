Sprite, v3.21
-------------

What is it? No, it's not the soda that claims, "Image is Nothing, Thirst
is Everything" :-) However, it is a useful module that allows you to access 
text-delimited databases, such as those exported from applications like 
MS Excel, using a _small_ subset of SQL.

Sprite has some cool advantages, like allowing you to embed Perl's powerful 
regular expressions -- not those wimpy ones that come with your commercial 
relational database engine -- into your queries.

Version 3.21 fixes several bugs, and allows you to trap errors generated
by Sprite. Take a look at the HISTORY and TIPS documents for more info!
