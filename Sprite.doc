NAME
     Sprite - Perl 5.0 module to manipulate text delimited
     databases.

SYNOPSIS
         use Sprite;

         $rdb = new Sprite ();

         $rdb->set_delimiter ("Read", "::");
         $rdb->set_delimiter ("Write", "::");

         $rdb->set_os ("UNIX");

         $rdb->sql (<<Query);
             .
             .
             .
         Query

         $rdb->close ();
         $rdb->close ($database);


DESCRIPTION
     Here is a simple database where the fields are delimted by
     commas:

         Player,Years,Points,Rebounds,Assists,Championships
         ...
         Larry Joe Bird,12,28,10,7,3
         Michael Jordan,10,33,6,5,3
         Earvin Magic Johnson,12,22,7,12,5
         ...

     _N_o_t_e: The first line must contain the field names (case
     sensitive).

Supported SQL Commands
     Here are a list of the SQL commands that are supported by
     Sprite:

     _s_e_l_e_c_t - retrieves records that match specified criteria:

              select col1 [,col2] from database
                  where (cond1 OPERATOR value1)
                  [and|or cond2 OPERATOR value2 ...]

          The '*' operator can be used to select all columns.

          The _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e is simply the file that contains the data.
          If the file is not in the current directory, the path

          must be specified.

          Sprite does _n_o_t support multiple tables (or commonly
          knows as "joins").

          Valid column names can be used where [cond1..n] and
          [value1..n] are expected, such as:

          _E_x_a_m_p_l_e _1:

              select Player, Points from my_db
                  where (Rebounds > Assists)

          The following SQL operators can be used: =, <, >, <=,
          >=, <> as well as Perl's special operators: =~ and !~.
          The =~ and !~ operators are used to specify regular
          expressions, such as:

          _E_x_a_m_p_l_e _2:

              select * from my_db
                  where (Name =~ /Bird$/i)

          Selects records where the Name column ends with "Bird"
          (case insensitive). For more information, look at a
          manual on regexps.

     _u_p_d_a_t_e - updates records that match specified criteria.

              update database set (cond1 OPERATOR value1)[,(cond2 OPERATOR value2)...]*
                 where (cond1 OPERATOR value1)
                 [and|or cond2 OPERATOR value2 ...]

              * = This feature was added as of version 3.1.

          _E_x_a_m_p_l_e:

              update my_db
                  set Championships = (Championships + 1)
                  where (Player = 'Larry Joe Bird')

             update my_db
                  set Championships = (Championships + 1),
                      Years = (12)

                  where (Player = 'Larry Joe Bird')


     _d_e_l_e_t_e - removes records that match specified criteria:

              delete from database
                  where (cond1 OPERATOR value1)
                  [and|or cond2 OPERATOR value2 ...]

          _E_x_a_m_p_l_e:

              delete from my_db
                  where (Player =~ /Johnson$/i) or
                        (Years > 12)


     _a_l_t_e_r - simplified version of SQL-92 counterpart
          Removes the specified column from the database. The
          other standard SQL functions for alter table are not
          supported:

              alter table database
                  drop column column-name

          _E_x_a_m_p_l_e:

              alter table my_db
                  drop column Championships


     _i_n_s_e_r_t - inserts a record into the database:

              insert into database
                  (col1, col2, ... coln)
              values
                  (val1, val2, ... valn)

          _E_x_a_m_p_l_e:

              insert into my_db
                  (Player, Years, Points, Championships)
              values
                  ('Kareem Abdul-Jabbar', 21, 27, 5)

          _N_o_t_e: You do not have to specify all of the fields in
          the database! Sprite also does not require you to
          specify the fields in the same order as that of the
          database.

          _N_o_t_e: You should make it a habit to quote strings.

METHODS
     Here are the four methods that are available:

     _s_e_t__d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r
          The set_delimiter function sets the read and write
          delimiter for the the SQL command. The delimiter is not

          limited to one character; you can have a string, and
          even a regexp (for reading only).

          _R_e_t_u_r_n _V_a_l_u_e

          None

     _s_e_t__o_s
          The set_os function can be used to notify Sprite as to
          the operating system that you're using. Valid arguments
          are: "UNIX", "VMS", "MSDOS", "NT" and "MacOS". UNIX is
          the default.

          _R_e_t_u_r_n _V_a_l_u_e

          The previous OS value

     _s_q_l  The sql function is used to pass a SQL command to this
          module. All of the SQL commands described above are
          supported. The _s_e_l_e_c_t SQL command returns an array
          containing the data, where the first element is the
          status. All of the other other SQL commands simply
          return a status.

          _R_e_t_u_r_n _V_a_l_u_e
              1 - Success
              0 - Error

     _c_l_o_s_e
          The close function closes the file, and destroys the
          database object. You can pass a filename to the
          function, in which case Sprite will save the database
          to that file.

          _R_e_t_u_r_n _V_a_l_u_e

          None

EXAMPLES
     Here are two simple examples that illustrate some of the
     functions of this module:

ADVANTAGES
     Here are the advantages of Sprite over mSQL by David Hughes
     available on the Net:

     Allows for column names to be specified in the update
     command:

     Perl's Regular Expressions allows for powerful pattern
     matching

     The database is stored as text. Very Important! Information
     can be added/modified/removed with a text editor.

     Can add/delete columns quickly and easily

DISADVANTAGES
     Here are the disadvantages of Sprite compared to mSQL:

     _S_p_e_e_d. No where close to mSQL! Sprite was designed to be
     used to manipulate very small databases (~1000-2000
     records).

     Does not have the ability to "join" multiple tables
     (databases) during a search operation. This will be added
     soon!

RESTRICTIONS
     1    If a value for a field contains the comma (,) character
          or the field delimiter, then you need to quote the
          value. Here is an example:

              insert into $database
              (One, Two)
              values
              ('$some_value', $two)

          The information in the variable $some_value _m_i_g_h_t
          contain the delimiter, so it is quoted -- you can use
          either the single quote (') or the double quote (").

     2    All single quotes and double quotes within a value must
          be escaped.  Looking back at the previous example, if
          you think the variable $some_value contains quotes, do
          the following:

SPRITE(1)      User Contributed Perl Documentation      SPRITE(1)



              $some_value =~ s/(['"])/\\$1/g;


     3    If a field's value contains a newline character, you
          need to convert the newline to some other character (or
          string):

              $some_value =~ s/\n/<BR>/g;


     4    If you want to search a field by using a regular
          expression:

              select * from $database
                  where (Player =~ /Bird/i)

          the only delimiter you are allowed is the standard one
          (i.e /../).  You _c_a_n_n_o_t use any other delimeter:

              select * from $database
                  where (Player =~ m|Bird|i)


     5    Field names can only be made up of the following
          characters:

              "A-Z", "a-z", and "_"

          In other words,

              [A-Za-z_]

     6    If your update value contains parentheses, you need to
          escape them:

             $rdb->sql (<<End_of_Query);

              update my_db
                  set Phone = ('\\(111\\) 222 3333')
                  where (Name = /Gundavaram\$/i)

             End_of_Query

          Notice how the "$" (matches end of line) is escaped as
          well!

SPRITE(1)      User Contributed Perl Documentation      SPRITE(1)



     v3.1 - June 18, 1996
          Added the following features:

     o+       As of this version, Sprite allows you to update
             multiple fields with a single _u_p_d_a_t_e command. See
             the _S_u_p_p_o_r_t_e_d _S_Q_L _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s section above.

     o+       You can execute your scripts with the following:

                     #!/usr/local/bin/perl5 -wT

                     use strict;

             Sprite no longer generates the "Use of uninitialized
             value..." errors.

     o+       For records that don't contain quotes or escaped
             strings, Perl's split is used to dramatically speed
             up database loading.

     o+       The _s_e_t__o_s function will allow you to set the
             operating system that you're using.

     o+       Added a "require 5.002" as Sprite fails on versions
             of Perl older than 5.002 with the following error:

                 "Bad _f_r_e_e() ignored at Sprite.pm..."

             Fixed the following bugs:

     o+       If you call the _c_l_o_s_e method with a database as an
             argument _w_i_t_h_o_u_t opening a database first, Sprite
             will warn you as opposed to wiping out the database,
             as was the case in earlier versions of Sprite.

     o+       Sprite no longer chops off the trailing "0" on
             records.

     o+       The _d_r_o_p _c_o_l_u_m_n works as it should.

     o+       You can safely escape parentheses in the _u_p_d_a_t_e
             command.

     o+       Extra spaces between field names in the _s_e_l_e_c_t
             command and values in the _u_p_d_a_t_e command no longer
             cause fatal errors.

     o+       In earlier versions of Sprite, if you opened two
             databases that were located in different
             directories, _b_u_t with the same name, Sprite
             incorrectly assumed that it was the same database.
             As a result, the second database would never be

             loaded.

     o+       Can be used on the Mac OS and Windows NT.

     v3.01 - March 5, 1996
          Fixed a bug in _p_a_r_s_e__e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n subroutine so that it
          recognizes the "_" character as valid in field names.

     v3.0 - Febraury 20, 1996
          Totally re-wrote parser; works reasonably well even in
          the worst case scenarios.

     v2.0 - November 23, 1995
          Fixed *numerous* errors in parsing, and added pod style
          documentation.

     v1.5 - September 10, 1995
          Created Perl 5 module instead of a command-line
          interface.

     v1.0 - September 7, 1995
          Initial Release
