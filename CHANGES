                           ----------------

     v3.1 - June 18, 1996

     Added the following features:

      *      As of this version, Sprite allows you to update
             multiple fields with a single update command. See
             the Supported SQL Commands section in the file
             Sprite.doc.

      *      You can execute your scripts with the following:

                     #!/usr/local/bin/perl5 -wT

                     use strict;

             Sprite no longer generates the "Use of uninitialized
             value..." errors.

     *       For records that don't contain quotes or escaped
             strings, Perl's split is used to dramatically speed
             up database loading.

     *       The set_os function will allow you to set the
             operating system that you're using.

     *       Added a "require 5.002" as Sprite fails on versions
             of Perl older than 5.002 with the following error:

                 "Bad free() ignored at Sprite.pm..."

     Fixed the following bugs:

     *       If you call the close method with a database as an
             argument without opening a database first, Sprite
             will warn you as opposed to wiping out the database,
             as was the case in earlier versions of Sprite.

     *       Sprite no longer chops off the trailing "0" on
             records.

     *       The drop column works as it should.

     *       You can safely escape parentheses in the update
             command.

     *       Extra spaces between field names in the select
             command and values in the update command no longer
             cause fatal errors.

     *       In earlier versions of Sprite, if you opened two
             databases that were located in different
             directories, but with the same name, Sprite
             incorrectly assumed that it was the same database.
             As a result, the second database would never be
             loaded.

     *       Can be used on the Mac OS and Windows NT.

     v3.01 - March 5, 1996

          Fixed a bug in parse_expression subroutine so that it
          recognizes the "_" character as valid in field names.

     v3.0 - Febraury 20, 1996

          Totally re-wrote parser; works reasonably well even in
          the worst case scenarios.

     v2.0 - November 23, 1995

          Fixed *numerous* errors in parsing, and added pod style
          documentation.

     v1.5 - September 10, 1995

          Created Perl 5 module instead of a command-line
          interface.

     v1.0 - September 7, 1995

          Initial Release
